Use Cases
1. User Login
Description: A user attempts to log in to the web application.
Actors: User
Preconditions: The user has a valid account with credentials (username and password).
Postconditions: The user is authenticated and receives an access token.
2. Administrator Login
Description: An administrator logs into the system with elevated privileges.
Actors: Administrator
Preconditions: The administrator has valid credentials and is marked as an administrator in the system.
Postconditions: The administrator is authenticated and receives an access token with admin privileges.
3. Access Protected Resource
Description: An authenticated user or administrator attempts to access a resource that requires authentication.
Actors: User, Administrator
Preconditions: The user or administrator is logged in and has a valid access token.
Postconditions: The resource is accessed if the user has the required permissions; otherwise, access is denied.
4. Role Management
Description: An administrator manages user roles and permissions.
Actors: Administrator
Preconditions: The administrator is logged in with the appropriate privileges.
Postconditions: User roles and permissions are updated in the system.
Acceptance Tests
1. User Login Test
Given: A user with a valid username and password.
When: The user submits their credentials to the login endpoint.
Then: The user should receive an HTTP 200 response with an access token in the response body.
2. Administrator Login Test
Given: An administrator with valid credentials.
When: The administrator submits their credentials to the login endpoint.
Then: The administrator should receive an HTTP 200 response with an access token and appropriate role-based claims.
3. Access Protected Resource Test
Given: An authenticated user with a valid access token.
When: The user tries to access a protected resource.
Then: If the user has the required permissions, they should receive an HTTP 200 response with the requested data; otherwise, an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) response should be returned.
4. Invalid Login Attempt Test
Given: A user with an incorrect username or password.
When: The user submits these credentials to the login endpoint.
Then: The user should receive an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response, indicating authentication failure.
5. Role Management Test
Given: An authenticated administrator.
When: The administrator updates the role of a user.
Then: The system should update the userâ€™s role, and the user should have access to resources according to the new role permissions. Verification should include checking access to previously restricted resources.
These use cases and acceptance tests provide a comprehensive view of the login and access control features, ensuring that authentication and authorization are properly managed and secure.
